# Cross-platform requirements.txt using Universal2 for macOS
# Supports: Windows, Linux, macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)
# Python: 3.8 or later

# ============================================================================
# pc-ble-driver-py with macOS rpath fix
# Platform-specific wheels using environment markers
# ============================================================================

# macOS (Universal2 - works on both Intel and Apple Silicon)
# Note: macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26, but works on macOS 11.0+ (backward compatible)
# To create this wheel: Use create_universal2_wheel.sh to combine ARM64 and x86_64 wheels
./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-macosx_26_0_universal2.whl; sys_platform == "darwin"

# Linux (x86_64) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl; sys_platform == "linux" and platform_machine == "x86_64"

# Linux (ARM64) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl; sys_platform == "linux" and platform_machine == "aarch64"

# Windows (x64) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-win_amd64.whl; sys_platform == "win32" and platform_machine == "AMD64"

# Windows (x86) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-win32.whl; sys_platform == "win32" and platform_machine == "x86"

# ============================================================================
# Required dependencies (all platforms)
# ============================================================================
wrapt>=1.0.0
cryptography>=3.0.0

# ============================================================================
# Notes:
# ============================================================================
# 1. The wheel uses cp38-abi3 which means it works with Python 3.8+
# 2. macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26, but works on macOS 11.0+ (backward compatible)
# 3. Universal2 wheel works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
# 4. To create Universal2 wheel: Build ARM64 and x86_64 separately, then use create_universal2_wheel.sh
# 5. The abi3 tag ensures compatibility across Python 3.8+ versions
# 6. Environment markers (after semicolon) ensure only the correct wheel is installed
