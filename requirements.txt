# Cross-platform requirements.txt for pc-ble-driver-py
# Supports: Windows, Linux, macOS
# Python: 3.8 or later

# ============================================================================
# pc-ble-driver-py with macOS rpath fix
# Platform-specific wheels using environment markers
# ============================================================================

# macOS (Apple Silicon / ARM64)
# Note: macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26, but works on macOS 11.0+ (backward compatible)

# macOS (Intel / x86_64)
# Note: macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26, but works on macOS 11.0+ (backward compatible)
./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-macosx_26_0_x86_64.whl; sys_platform == "darwin" and platform_machine == "x86_64"

# Linux (x86_64) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl; sys_platform == "linux" and platform_machine == "x86_64"

# Linux (ARM64) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl; sys_platform == "linux" and platform_machine == "aarch64"

# Windows (x64) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-win_amd64.whl; sys_platform == "win32" and platform_machine == "AMD64"

# Windows (x86) - uncomment if you have this wheel
# ./wheels/pc_ble_driver_py-0.17.10-cp38-abi3-win32.whl; sys_platform == "win32" and platform_machine == "x86"

# ============================================================================
# Required dependencies (all platforms)
# ============================================================================
wrapt>=1.0.0
cryptography>=3.0.0

# ============================================================================
# Notes:
# ============================================================================
# 1. The wheel uses cp38-abi3 which means it works with Python 3.8+
# 2. macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26, but works on macOS 11.0+ (backward compatible)
# 3. You need to build/obtain wheels for each platform you want to support
# 4. macOS Intel (x86_64) wheel - build using BUILDING_MACOS_INTEL.md or BUILD_INTEL_WHEEL.sh
#    OR use Universal2 wheel (recommended) - see requirements_universal2.txt
# 5. The abi3 tag ensures compatibility across Python 3.8+ versions
# 6. Environment markers (after semicolon) ensure only the correct wheel is installed
# 7. For Universal2 wheels (both Intel and ARM), see requirements_universal2.txt
# 8. RECOMMENDATION: Use Universal2 for macOS (simpler, one wheel for both architectures)
