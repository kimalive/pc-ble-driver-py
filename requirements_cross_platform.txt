# pc-ble-driver-py with macOS rpath fix
# ============================================================================

# macOS (Apple Silicon / ARM64)
# Note: macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26 (macOS 15 Sequoia)
# but is backward compatible with macOS 11.0+ (Big Sur and later)

# ============================================================================
# Required dependencies (all platforms)
# ============================================================================
wrapt>=1.0.0
cryptography>=3.0.0

# ============================================================================
# Notes:
# ============================================================================
# 1. The wheel uses cp38-abi3 which means it works with Python 3.8+
# 2. macosx_26_0 means built for macOS 26, but works on macOS 11.0+ (backward compatible)
# 3. You need to build/obtain wheels for each platform you want to support
# 4. Uncomment the lines for platforms you have wheels for
# 5. The abi3 tag ensures compatibility across Python 3.8+ versions
