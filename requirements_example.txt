# Example requirements.txt for using pc-ble-driver-py from GitHub Releases
#
# Replace VERSION with your release version (e.g., 0.17.10)
# Replace PYTHON_VERSION with your Python version (e.g., cp312 for Python 3.12)
# Replace ARCH with your architecture (x86_64 for Intel Mac, arm64 for Apple Silicon)

# Option 1: Direct wheel URL (recommended)
# For x86_64 (Intel Mac)
